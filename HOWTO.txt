    HOWTO
   -------
    
    *File Encryption*
Select the input file to be encrypted. Generate the name for the output file 
by pressing [Name output file]. A different name may be specified.
Pass to the "Encryption" frame. Here input the encryption password. 
It is possible to combine the encryption password with a key file. This may be
any kind of file.
Choose the type of output file pressing [Binary] or [Text].
Press [Encrypt] or <ctrl-e> to generate the encrypted output.

    *File Decryption*
After the proper input and output files have been specified, use the same steps
as for the encryption phase, then press [Decrypt] or <ctrl-d>.

    *On The Fly*
To encrypt/decrypt a text string press [On The Fly]. Two text entries will
appear, one for the clear text and the other for the encrypted text.
Input the encryption password and use [Encrypt] and [Decrypt] or <ctrl-e> and
<ctrl-d>.

    *Base64 Encoding/Decoding*
Specify input and output files, then press [Encode] or [Decode] to obtain
the output file as a base64 encoded text string.

    *Building a trojan*
Follow this procedure to append a secret file to another file. The resulting
trojan may be used to send the secret file through firewalls and antivirus
software barriers. The secret file can then be restored from the trojan.
Terms:
 'soldier': the secret file
 'horse': file to which the secret file will be appended
 'trojan': horse file that embeds the secret file

    Building the trojan
- Encrypt the 'soldier' file with AES in text mode
- Concatenate 'soldier' to 'horse'
    Input file = horse, the file that will hold the soldier, eg. an image
    Output file = soldier
    Press the combination <Control-Alt-7> to build the 'trojan'
    The trojan will have the same name of horse with '_copy' appended
    
    Restoring 'soldier' from 'trojan'
- Extract 'soldier' from 'horse'
    Input file = trojan
    Output file = name of your choice
    Press the combination <Control-Alt-8> to extract the soldier
- Decrypt 'soldier' with AES
